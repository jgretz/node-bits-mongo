# node-bits-mongo
node-bits-mongo allows a node-bits app access to a mongo database. node-bits-mongo will use the schema defined by other bits in the loadSchema step as its schema definition.

## Install
```
npm install node-bits-mongo --save
```

or

```
yarn add node-bits-mongo
```

## Configuration
```
nodeBitsMongo({
  connection: 'connection-string',
  hooks: [
    nodeBitsPassword(),
  ],
}),
```

### connection
This is the connection string to the mongo database.

### runSeeds
If runSeeds is included and set to true, the mongo db will look for seeds as defined in the schema, and insert them into the database

### hooks
hooks is an array of functions that accepts a single args parameter. The property values  passed to args and optional actions varys by operation and are described below:

##### Before execution
* name: the name of the model
* schema: the defined schema object for this model
* action: QUERY, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* stage: BEFORE, AFTER
* options: these are the options passed to the database on the query

Any value returned will be used as the options forward. If you do not want this effect, return null.

##### After Execution
* name: the name of the model
* schema: the defined schema object for this model
* action: QUERY, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
* stage: BEFORE, AFTER
* options: these are the options passed to the database on the query
* results: the results returned by the database

#### node-bits-password
[node-bits-password](https://github.com/jgretz/node-bits-password) implements the logic for the PASSWORD type fields and is a common hook. See the bit's documentation for more information.

## Methods
